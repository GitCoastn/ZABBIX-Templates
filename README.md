# ZABBIX-Templates
Templates for ZABBIX built on my own - Feel free to contribute
## Essential things to say
* I often change the intervals and history periods to fit my needs. So please check if you have make do any changes for your deployment. However, my templates should never blow up your database as I'm underbidding the standard values in 99% of the cases.
* I always try to apply the naming logic of ZABBIX, as those random template names and groups on share.zabbix.com are so annoying.
* I'm an absolute GitHub-Noob, so I use this more as a public file provider right now. However, I'm trying to learn and improve. Keep that in mind when you see any issues with versioning, commits or whatever.
* I'm not a native english speaker. Whilst trying my best, there could be grammatical issues in things like triggers and descriptions. As we use english VMs wherever we can, there should never be an issue with items of a template. Things like PerfMon-Parameters will always be kept numerical to avoid localisation issues.
